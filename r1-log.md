The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Thursday, February 1, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Was able to shuffle array of images and add those images to the cards. Struggled with getting the photos to hide/show. 
*update* Figured out how to hide/show images using toggleClass.

### R1D2
Continued working on the memory game. Created a landing page with a start button that lead to the gameboard. Figured out the logic to display only two images at a time. After clicking two cards, checked if they aren't a match, left both visible for 1 second before flipping back. 

### R1D3-D5
Worked on the memory game. Added unique IDs to cards. Edited checkWin() function to show all paired cards using setTimeout before showing the 'Congratulations' screen and the user's final score. Added a button to allow the user to play a new game.

### R1D6
Organized file folders for the memory game repo on GitHub. Still struggling with two last requirements of the memory game: 1) disabling a click on a card that's already been clicked without locking the card afterward and 2) storing the best score using local storage and displaying it on the screen. Have been frustrated with these last two tasks over the past two days. Took a break from the memory game to work on coding challenges. Practiced problems using reduce and high order functions.
