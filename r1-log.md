# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Charmaine]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Thursday, February 1, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Was able to shuffle array of images and add those images to the cards. Struggled with getting the photos to hide/show. 
*update* Figured out how to hide/show images using toggleClass.

### R1D2
Continued working on the memory game. Created a landing page with a start button that lead to the gameboard. Figured out the logic to display only two images at a time. After clicking two cards, checked if they aren't a match, left both visible for 1 second before flipping back. 

### R1D3-D5
Worked on the memory game. Added unique IDs to cards. Edited checkWin() function to show all paired cards using setTimeout before showing the 'Congratulations' screen and the user's final score. Added a button to allow the user to play a new game.

### R1D6
Organized file folders for the memory game repo on GitHub. Still struggling with two last requirements of the memory game: 1) disabling a click on a card that's already been clicked without locking the card afterward and 2) storing the best score using local storage and displaying it on the screen. Have been frustrated with these last two tasks over the past two days. Took a break from the memory game to work on coding challenges. Practiced problems using reduce and high order functions. 

### R1D7
Finally finished the memory game! After submitting the game, I checked the recently updated requirements only to find that it needed to be done in vanilla JavaScript. NO jQuery. Created a separate file for vanilla JS and started working on transferring the jQuery code to pure JS. Took a break from the memory game to work on Repl.it classroom problems. 

### R1D8
Worked on coding challenges and practicing simple JavaScript algorithms. Trying to improve my problem solving skills. 

### R1D9
Worked on coding challenges and practiced whiteboarding. Learned how to diagram each step of the problem. Solified my understanding of the .reduce() array method. 

### R1D10-11
Worked on coding challenges in the repl.it classroom. Revisted older problems to solidify understanding of simple javascript algorithms. 

### R1D12
Reviewed anonymous functions, IIFE's, and hoisting. 

### R1D13
Solved 4 problems in the repl.it classroom. Problems include: rotating a matrix clockwise and counterclockwise, zipping and unzipping values in nested arrays. Reviewed DOM

### R1D14 
Solved more repl.it problems. Got more practice using reduce. Switched text editors from Sublime to VS Code. 

### R1D15 
Completed javascript memory game to include local storage. 

### R1D16
